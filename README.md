### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started my programming journey first by becoming an open-source contributor of Firefox, meanwhile contributing to various projects on GitHub as well. I advocate for open-source software at my job and I hope to be able to do open-source work full-time, working on projects ranging from operating systems and low-level components all the way up to user interfaces and web applications.

I am mainly interested in these areas:
- Low-level programming with ASM, C, Rust and similar languages
- Mathematical optimisations
- GPU and rendering technologies
- Functional programming (mainly Haskell) and Category Theory
- Developer tools: making life of engineers easier

I sometimes write about random stuff on my blog: [mahdi.blog](https://mahdi.blog/)

You can reach me on [mdibaiee@pm.me](mailto:mdibaiee@pm.me). I'm happy to collaborate on open-source projects or initiatives!
